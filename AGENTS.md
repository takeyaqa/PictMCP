# PictMCP

## Project overview

PictMCP is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides pairwise combinatorial testing capabilities to AI assistants. It wraps the PICT (Pairwise Independent Combinatorial Testing) algorithm via WebAssembly, enabling AI clients to generate optimized test case combinations.
